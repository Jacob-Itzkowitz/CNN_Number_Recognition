Basic CNN model trained using the mnist dataset to guess the numbers that I wrote on a piece of paper. The current version is accurate using the test data however is inaccurate when guessing the numbers I wrote on a piece of paper. To make it more accurate I plan on rotating the mnist dataset numbers left and right to get a more diverse range of numbers with tilts to make it more accurate when guessing the numbers I wrote on a piece of paper.
