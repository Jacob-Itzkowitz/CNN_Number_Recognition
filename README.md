Work Process:

Initially I did edge detection to find the numbers and put it into a Machine learning model to detect the numbers
Next I created  a matrix of RGB values and just putting that through a Machine learning model

Data collection:
  I started by drawing numbers on a white piece of paper then taking pictures and downloading them on my computer in the Pycharms directory
